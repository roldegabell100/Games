Snake Game

I will be creaing a Snake game that i will add my own twist to it

 <!-- // todo: make the ball = random color -> changed to red, green, blue, orange, -->
<!--// todo: make it so when the snake eats the ball it takes the color of the ball -->
<!-- todo: create a intro screen with the option to start the game -->
 <!-- todo: make the space key pauses the game and unpause the game -->
 <!--^ todo: set the game similarly to the car game. where you get 3 colors the same you get a point. -->
<!-- todo: line 9 changed, the game is now set to a score system. when user gets two colors in a wow they score two point-->
<!-- todo: add opsicles make the opsticle change randomly after the Food is eaten-->
<!--^ todo: score funtion doesn't exist. i have no idea why the score board is working. check if thinker has a score function. -->
